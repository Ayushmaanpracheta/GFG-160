// Implement Atoi:
// Question:
/*
Given a string s, the objective is to convert it into integer format without utilizing any built-in functions. Refer the below steps to know about atoi() function.

Cases for atoi() conversion:

Skip any leading whitespaces.
Check for a sign (‘+’ or ‘-‘), default to positive if no sign is present.
Read the integer by ignoring leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or end of the string is reached. If no digits are present, return 0.
If the integer is greater than 231 – 1, then return 231 – 1 and if the integer is smaller than -231, then return -231.
Examples:

Input: s = "-123"
Output: -123
Explanation: It is possible to convert -123 into an integer so we returned in the form of an integer
Input: s = "  -"
Output: 0
Explanation: No digits are present, therefore the returned answer is 0.
Input: s = " 1231231231311133"
Output: 2147483647
Explanation: The converted number will be greater than 231 – 1, therefore print 231 – 1 = 2147483647.
Input: s = "-999999999999"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The converted number is smaller than -231, therefore print -231 = -2147483648.
Input: s = "  -0012gfg4"
Output: -12
Explanation: Nothing is read after -12 as a non-digit character ‘g’ was encountered.

// Approach 1: 
/*
The basic idea is to follow the atoi() algorithm in order and covering all the edge cases:

1.Skip the leading whitespaces by iterating from the first character.
2.Now, check for at most one sign character ('+' or '-') and maintain a sign variable to keep track of the sign of the number.
3.Finally, read all the digits and construct the number until the first non-digit character is encountered or end of the input string is reached.
4.While constructing the number, if the number becomes greater than 231 - 1, print 231 - 1. Similarly, if the number becomes less than -231, print -231
